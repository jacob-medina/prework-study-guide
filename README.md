# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This website was created to refresh on the basics of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git**. The Prework Study Guide helps new bootcamp students study web development topics like HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. For students who don't know where to start, the console prints out a random subject for them to study. Through this project, I mainly learned how to develop a project properly using GitHub.
